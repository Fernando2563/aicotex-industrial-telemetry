# Aicotex Industrial Telemetry

Industrial telemetry and intelligent monitoring platform developed in Python.

## Overview

Aicotex is a modular industrial monitoring architecture designed for:

- Sensor abstraction
- Control logic processing
- Structured telemetry publishing
- Future cloud and MQTT integration

The system simulates a temperature control environment but is structured for real-world industrial integration (Modbus, BACnet, OPC-UA).
